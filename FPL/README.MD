Welcome!

There are four main Jupyter notebooks available here. Three of these notebooks are related to each other and should be read in the following order;
* "WebScraping_Past_Seasons.ipynb" - Scraping data from FBREF. 
* "EDA" - Data cleaning, pattern exploration and creating/optimizing/evaluating models.  
* "Model" - Creating a predictive dataframe and using an ensemble of models found in "EDA" to predict goals. 

The fourth notebook, "FPL_Main", is a stand-alone, older approach that doesn't incorporate machine learning but involves various data cleaning techniques such as fuzzy-matching, combining multiple data sources, creating timetables, and creating custom modifiers like home/away modifiers for attack and defense.
