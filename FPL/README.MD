## Welcome!

There are four Jupyter notebooks available here. Three of these notebooks are related to each other and should be read in the following order;
* "WebScraping_Past_Seasons.ipynb" - Scraping data from FBREF for input variables to predict goals scored. 
* "EDA" - Data cleaning, pattern exploration and creating/optimizing/evaluating models based off of data scraped from FBREF (#### main notebook).
* "Model" - Creating a predictive dataframe and using an ensemble of models created in "EDA" to predict goals. 

The fourth notebook, "FPL_Main", is an independent and older method that does not use machine learning. It employs several data cleaning methods like fuzzy matching, merging multiple data sources, generating schedules, and devising customized home/away modifiers for attack and defense.
