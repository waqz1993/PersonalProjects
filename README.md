# Main Projects

## Twitter Sentiment vs Future Stock Prices :moneybag:

### Key Technical Steps

* NLP Modelling: Evaluated various pre-trained BERT models on multiple financial datasets, using cloud computing, to ascertain the best model for sentiment analysis.

* Data Collection: Acquired a Twitter dataset encompassing over 150,000 tweets from prominent news sources spanning 2018-2022.

Tested for twitter sentiment and future price change whilst striating against company size and sector. Found statistically significant correlations within certain contexts.

## Currency and Retail Sentiment Trading Project :moneybag:

### Key Technical Steps

* Stats - Practical discussion of data normalization testing methods, parametric vs non-parametric correlation testing, sample sizes and transformation methods. 

* Python - The aforementioned stats work is accomplished using the SciPy and NumPy libraries. General data cleansing is also demonstrated. 

Retail traders, as opposed to institutional traders, act as individuals investing their own money. The activity of retail traders has historically been made unavailable to the public. However, recently certain brokerages have been willing to buck this trend and release data on the activity of their retail traders. 

This project serves as an exploration of retail activity and whether their activity can serve as a proxy for sentiment. Initial findings are promising, with retail activity having weak-moderate correlation with future price change (within certain contexts).

## Fantasy Football League (FPL) Project :soccer:

### Key Technical Steps

* Machine Learning - Create a Ensemble Regression Model from various features. Our model has a higher correlation with goals than the current gold standard (xG). 

* Extensive Data Cleaning - Utilize Python for combining data sources, extensive cleaning, timetable production and more. Showcase proficiency in multiple python libraries. 

* API/Web Scraping - Utilize Python to access data from the official FPL API and a web scraper for data from a football stats website and proceed to combine multiple datasets (fuzzy-matching included).

Fantasy Football is a fantasy game played by over 11 million players worldwide every year. Managers attempt to pick the best players in the premier league with hopes of selecting players who will return the most points week to week. 

This project utilizes past data to make predictions as to which teams and players will return the most points. The AI based point prediction system developed in this project to come up in the top .02 and .5% in the two previous fantasy seasons.
